New submission

Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  Culpepper (19:56)
  ErRUM (19:36)
  
- This is a new release.
- Based on feedback from a previous submission:
  - We've shorten the title from 75 characters to 60 characters.
  - One of the reported misspelling is last name of one of the paper's authors and
    the second misspelling is the acronym name for the method.
  - We've downsampled an estimation of the example as much as possible. The 
    example should CRAN's 5 second limitation.
